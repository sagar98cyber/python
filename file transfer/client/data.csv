LICENSE AGREEMENT

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR Belkasoft Evidence Center X (EULA)
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY 

This end user license agreement is a legally binding contract between 
yourself (as a natural or a legal person) and the company Belkasoft for 
the software product named above. By installing the software product, 
you declare your agreement with all conditions of the license 
agreement.
If you do not agree with the conditions of the license agreement, you 
are not entitled to install or use the software product.
The software product is protected by copyright laws and international 
copyright contracts as well as other laws and agreements concerning 
intellectual property. 

1. Subject of the contract
The subject of this contract is the computer program, the description 
thereof and the user manual as well as any other accompanying 
written material. This will henceforth also be referred to as "software".
Belkasoft wishes to point out that, at the current state of technology, it 
is not possible to create software that works perfectly in all applications 
and combinations. The subject of this contract is therefore a software 
program that is fit for the purposes detailed in the description and the 
user manual.

You are entitled to test the demo version of software free of charge 
and without obligation. If you wish to use fully featured version of the 
software, you must purchase the relevant license.

2. License granting 

There are two kinds of licensing: fixed and floating.

Fixed license is bound to a single computer and allows usage by one 
user of computer only.

Floaing license can be used on any computer within the same organization,
while a USB product key is inserted in a computer.

Fixed license

For the duration of this contract, Belkasoft grants you the simple, non-
exclusive and personal right (henceforth referred to as "license") to use 
a copy of the software on a single computer. If this single computer 
has multiple users, this user right applies to only one user of the 
system.
As a license-holder, you may physically transfer the software (i.e. 
saved on a data carrying medium), on condition that it will not be used 
on more than one computer at a time. Further use, especially repeated 
installation, use, and subsequent uninstallation on various computers 
(floating license) is prohibited.
You can use the software on multiple computers only in case you have 
purchased the corresponding multiple license.

Floating license

For the duration of this contract, Belkasoft grants you the simple, non-
exclusive and personal right (henceforth referred to as "license") to use 
a copy of the software on any computer within organization.

As a license-holder, you may physically transfer the software (i.e. 
saved on a data carrying medium). You can use the software on multiple 
computers with product USB key inserted.

3. Description of further rights and limits 
The license-holder is prohibited from;
(a)	altering, translating, reverse-developing, decompiling or 
disassembling the software without the advance written permission of 
Belkasoft  
(b)	creating products derived from the software or making copies 
of the written material, translating or altering the written material or 
creating products derived from the written material
(c)	distributing copies of the software to third parties
(d)	changing or removing the copyright mark on the copies of the 
software 
(e)	renting out, - or lending the software 
The license holder is permitted to transfer all rights from this license 
agreement permanently to another person, provided that the recipient 
also agrees to all conditions of this license. 
The license holder must use the software only in compliance with all 
relevant laws. 

4. Ownership of rights
Any ownership rights applying to the software, including but not limited 
to copyright laws, belong to Belkasoft. Any not explicitly claimed rights 
are reserved by Belkasoft.
The purchase of a license for a product simply grants a right to use the 
software as described in the conditions of the license agreement. This 
does not imply a right to the software itself. In particular, Belkasoft 
reserves all publication, multiplication, processing and utilization rights 
to the software. 

5. Reproduction
The software and accompanying written material are protected by 
copyright laws. The user has the right to create copies of the software 
for back-up and archiving purposes. He or she is thereby also obliged 
to reproduce Belkasoft's copyright mark on the physical medium or in 
the program. A copyright mark present in the software may not be 
removed. Copying or reproducing the software in original or altered 
form, or merged with or included in other software, is explicitly 
forbidden. 
Provided you pass on only the test version, you may reproduce the 
installation data as often as you wish. However, you may only pass on 
exact copies and may not alter these in any way. 
For such reproduction, you may not demand any kind of 
compensation. You may not distribute or market this product in 
combination with other products - whether commercially or non-
commercially - without the advance written permission of Belkasoft.

6. Length of the agreement
This agreement is valid indefinitely. The right of a license-holder to use 
this software is removed automatically and without notice if he or she 
violates one of the terms of this agreement. At the end of the period of 
right to use, the license-holder is obliged to destroy the software, all 
copies of the software, and the written material. 

7. Compensation for breach of contract
Belkasoft would like to point out that you are responsible for any 
damages arising from breach of copyright if you violate these contract 
terms.

8. Changes and Updates
Belkasoft is entitled to update the software as it wishes. Belkasoft is 
not obliged to make updated versions available to license holders who 
have not registered their product with Belkasoft, or who have not paid 
the update fee. Any additional software code that is made available to 
you as an update is considered a part of the software and is therefore 
subject to the terms of this agreement. 

9. Belkasoft's Guarantees and Responsibility 
(a)	Belkasoft guarantees the original license-holder that the data 
medium carrying the software is free of errors at the point of delivery, 
assuming normal operating conditions and a normal level of 
maintenance. 
(b)	If the delivered data carrier is faulty, the purchaser can demand 
a replacement during the 24-month guarantee period. For this, he or 
she must return the data carrier, any back-up copies and the written 
material along with a copy of the invoice or receipt to Belkasoft or to 
the dealer where the product was purchased.
 (c)	If a fault as described in clause 9 b is not corrected by means 
of a replacement delivery within a reasonable time period, the 
purchaser can demand either that the sale price be reduced or that the 
contract be canceled.
 (d)	For these reasons and for those mentioned in clause 1 of this 
contract, Belkasoft accepts no responsibility for mistakes in the 
software. In particular, Belkasoft does not guarantee that the software 
will meet the particular requirements and demands of the purchaser or 
that it will function together with other software he or she has chosen. 
The purchaser is responsible for the correct choice of software and the 
consequences of the use of that software, as well as the results aimed 
at or intended. The same principle applies to the written material that 
accompanies the software. If the software is fundamentally unfit for 
use as described in clause 1, the customer has the right to cancel the 
contract. Belkasoft has the same right should the creation of software 
that is fundamentally fit for use as described in clause 1 not be 
practically possible.

10. Exclusion of incidental, consequential and certain other damages.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL 
BELKASOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER 
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR: LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF 
CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY, 
LOSS OF PRIVACY, FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY (INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH OR OF 
REASONABLE CARE), NEGLIGENCE, AND ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS 
WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT SERVICES, THE PROVISION OF OR 
FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION 
WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE FAULT, TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF 
WARRANTY OF BELKASOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER, AND EVEN IF BELKASOFT OR ANY 
SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
